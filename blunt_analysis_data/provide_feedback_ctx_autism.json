    "feedback": "It might be helpful for Speaker 2 to acknowledge Speaker 1's idea before expressing concerns. This can create a more collaborative atmosphere. For example, Speaker 2 could say: 'Building a birdhouse sounds like a nice idea. I do worry, though, that we might not maintain it and it could end up collecting dust. What if we find a way to ensure we take care of it regularly?'"
