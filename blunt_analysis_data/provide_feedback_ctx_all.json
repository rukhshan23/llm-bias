This approach can foster a more positive and collaborative conversation."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "It might help both speakers to express their perspectives more constructively.

This allows for clearer communication and makes it easier to find a compromise."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "Speaker 2, it would be helpful to provide support and encouragement rather than a blanket statement dismissing Speaker 1's feelings.

  },
  {
    "feedback": "Speaker 2's response was quite blunt and could be perceived as hurtful. It's important to consider tone and the potential impact of our words. I recommend offering constructive criticism that encourages and motivates. For instance, they could have said: 'Podcasts can be a lot of work.
