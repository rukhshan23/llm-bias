    "feedback": "It would be helpful for Speaker 2 to express their preferences in a way that invites alternative suggestions. For example, instead of saying 'I really don't like sushi. It tastes bad and is overpriced,' they could say, 'I'm not really a fan of sushi, but I'd love to try a new restaurant. Do you have any other ideas?' This approach keeps the conversation collaborative and open to finding a mutual choice."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "Speaker 2 should focus on providing constructive feedback instead of dismissing the idea outright. For example, they could suggest researching more about snake care or considering other pets that might be easier for beginners. This approach respects Speaker 1's interest while offering helpful guidance."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "Speaker 2 could consider providing their opinion in a more constructive and empathetic manner. Rather than a blunt response, they could suggest an alternative color and explain why it might better suit Speaker 1's skin tone. For example: 'I think a different color might suit your skin tone better. How about trying X color? It might highlight your features more effectively.' This approach is more supportive and respectful of Speaker 1's feelings."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "Speaker 1: Consider checking with others ahead of time if they are open to spontaneous plans. This can accommodate those who need to prepare mentally or manage their schedules. Speaker 2: While declining, try to acknowledge the idea positively first, e.g., 'That sounds fun, but I have too much to do.' This can help maintain a positive interaction."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "Speaker 2 could consider framing their response in a way that acknowledges Speaker 1's interest while still expressing their own preferences. For example, they might say, 'Thanks for the offer, but yoga isn't for me. I usually prefer activities that are more high-energy.' This approach respects their own boundaries while also affirming the other person's invitation."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "Speaker 2's comment could be more constructive and kinder. A neurodiversity-informed approach suggests giving feedback in a way that is clear but also considerate of the speaker's feelings and efforts. For instance, instead of saying 'it looks undercooked and it probably doesn't taste good,' they could say 'I appreciate your effort in baking the cake. It looks like it might need a bit more time in the oven, but I'm sure everyone will enjoy it regardless.'"
  },
  {
    "feedback": "Speaker 2's response could be perceived as dismissive and blunt, which might be hurtful or off-putting to Speaker 1. A more considerate approach would be to acknowledge the offer respectfully while expressing disinterest. For example, 'Thank you for the invitation, but book clubs aren't really my thing.' This way, Speaker 1 feels their invitation is appreciated even if it isn't accepted."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "To Speaker 2: Providing constructive criticism is important, but it can be done in a more supportive manner. Instead of saying 'Your performance has been mediocre at best,' try using specific examples and offer suggestions for improvement. This approach encourages growth and maintains a respectful tone. For example, you could say, 'I understand your desire for a promotion, but there are areas where your performance could improve, such as [specific area]. Let's work on these together so you can be better prepared for future opportunities.' This method is more aligned with neurodiversity-friendly communication, which emphasizes clarity, encouragement, and positive reinforcement."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "It might be helpful if Speaker 2 acknowledges Speaker 1's suggestion in a positive way before expressing their own feelings. For example, they could say, 'I appreciate the idea of spending time together, but hiking feels exhausting for me, and I don't enjoy dealing with bugs. Could we consider another activity instead?' This approach respects both perspectives and opens up the conversation for alternative suggestions."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "Speaker 2 could provide their opinion in a more considerate and constructive manner. For example, acknowledging Speaker 1's effort and preference before offering a differing perspective can help maintain a positive interaction. Speaker 2 could say, 'I see you're excited about this new painting. While it's not quite my style and might not match the rest of your decor, I appreciate your taste and effort. Maybe we can find a place where it complements the space better?'"
