    "autistic": "Speaker 2",
    "explanation": "Speaker 2's response is brief and to the point, which can be a communication trait seen in individuals on the autism spectrum. They may prefer direct and straightforward communication without elaborating on their reasoning. This aligns with common autistic traits of valuing clear and concise exchanges, whereas Speaker 1's response is more elaborative and open-ended."
