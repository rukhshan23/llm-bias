    "feedback": "Speaker 2, your response may come across as dismissive or sarcastic, which can exacerbate the frustration of Speaker 1. It's important to acknowledge Speaker 1's feelings directly. A more supportive response could be, 'I can see you're frustrated with the delays. Is there anything specific that's causing the hold-up that we can address?'"
  },
  {
    "feedback": "Speaker 1, your statement uses an idiom that might be confusing. Rephrasing it to something more specific could improve clarity. Speaker 2, asking for clarification is a good practice and helps in understanding the context better. Both should aim for clear, direct communication to ensure mutual understanding."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "The exchange demonstrates clear communication, but to improve it, Speaker 2 might benefit from understanding the idiom Speaker 1 used. Speaker 1's phrase, 'too many irons in the fire,' means taking on too many activities or responsibilities. Speaker 2's response, although creative, misses the idiomatic meaning and could confuse the conversation. For clarity, Speaker 2 could focus on the underlying concern implied in the idiom by saying, 'That sounds overwhelming, how can I help?' This approach shows empathy and understanding, which is particularly helpful in ensuring effective communication with an autistic person."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "Speaker 1 used an idiom which might not be universally understood, especially by someone with autism who might interpret language more literally. It would be helpful for Speaker 1 to clarify that 'heart of gold' means being very kind and generous. Speaker 2's question indicates a literal interpretation, which is valid. Encouraging Speaker 2 to ask for clarification when they encounter unfamiliar phrases can improve understanding."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "The exchange shows that Speaker 1 used a common metaphor, 'this idea has wings,' to express excitement and momentum about the idea. Speaker 2 responded literally, which could indicate a desire for clarity or comprehension. To improve communication, Speaker 1 could ensure their metaphors are clearly understood, and Speaker 2 could clarify their need for explicit language. Acknowledging each other's communication styles and seeking to understand them can enhance mutual understanding."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "Speaker 1: Be mindful that idiomatic expressions may not be universally understood, especially by neurodiverse individuals. Consider being more explicit about the actions taken. Speaker 2: Asking for clarification is a good approach; however, focusing on the literal meaning might lead to misunderstanding. Try asking what was meant by 'stirred the pot' to better engage in the conversation."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "Speaker 2 may benefit from understanding the metaphor used by Speaker 1. While Speaker 1 is using 'skating on thin ice' as a metaphor for taking a risk, Speaker 2 has taken it literally. It might be helpful for Speaker 1 to clarify their metaphor to ensure clear communication. Speaker 1 could say something like, 'I meant that they are taking a big risk with their plan.' This would provide clarity and prevent misunderstandings."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "Speaker 1 has used a metaphor to describe someone's extensive knowledge, while Speaker 2 took it literally. Metaphorical language can sometimes be confusing for autistic individuals. To improve communication, Speaker 1 could provide more context or clarify their intent. Alternatively, Speaker 2 might ask for clarification if something seems unclear. Both speakers could work towards ensuring their expressions and interpretations align by asking follow-up questions or restating in more concrete terms."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "While Speaker 2's response is humorous and can be interpreted as a creative solution, it may not directly address Speaker 1's feelings or struggle. It could be beneficial for Speaker 2 to first acknowledge Speaker 1's frustration and then offer concrete assistance or ask for more details on the specific challenges they are facing. This approach can help create a more supportive environment, respecting the potential need for clear and direct communication, especially for individuals who may be autistic."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "Speaker 1 used a metaphor that may not have been clear to Speaker 2. Speaker 1 could be more explicit by saying something like 'His words were very hurtful.' Speaker 2 can ask for clarification if they do not understand a metaphor or expression, such as 'What do you mean by that?'. This approach encourages clear and straightforward communication, which can be especially helpful for autistic individuals who might find figurative language challenging."
