    "feedback": "Speaker 2, it seems you took the idiom 'hit the hay' literally, which can be a common trait in autistic individuals who may interpret language more concretely. To enhance understanding, it could be helpful for Speaker 1 to clarify the idiom by saying 'I'm going to bed early tonight.' Speaker 2 could also ask for clarification if an idiom is confusing. It's important to communicate in ways that consider the diverse ways people process language."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "Speaker 1 used an idiom which may not be clear to everyone, including some autistic individuals who might interpret language more literally. It's important to recognize that idiomatic expressions can be confusing. Speaker 2's response shows a literal interpretation of the phrase, highlighting the need for straightforward language. To improve understanding, Speaker 1 could use more direct language or explain the idiom to ensure clear communication."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "Speaker 1 used an idiom, 'hit the nail on the head,' which might be confusing for those who interpret language more literally, such as some autistic individuals. It's helpful to be mindful of language that can be interpreted in multiple ways. Clarifying that it was a metaphor for making a very accurate suggestion could make the conversation more inclusive. Speaker 2 asked for clarification, which is a constructive way to handle confusion. Both speakers should continue to communicate clearly and seek clarification when needed."

  {
    "feedback": "Speaker 1 used an idiom ('in hot water') which can be confusing to those who interpret language literally, including many autistic individuals. It's helpful to use clear and direct language. Perhaps say 'He's in trouble after that mistake' to avoid confusion."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "Speaker 1, your metaphorical language might be confusing if not everyone is familiar with the expression 'herding cats'. Speaker 2, your literal interpretation could be a sign of different cognitive processing, which is valid. Clarifying or explaining metaphors can help ensure mutual understanding in conversations. Both of you might benefit from explicitly checking in to confirm shared meanings."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "Speaker 1, you used an idiom ('tough nut to crack') which may not be easily understood by someone who interprets language literally. Speaker 2, it appears you interpreted the idiom literally, which is a valid way to approach it. In future exchanges, it might be helpful for Speaker 1 to use more straightforward language to ensure clear communication for all parties involved."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "Speaker 1 is using a metaphor to express a strong emotional reaction, while Speaker 2 may be interpreting the statement literally, which can be common among autistic individuals. It's important to recognize and appreciate different communication styles. Speaker 1 could try using more direct language if they notice that metaphors cause confusion, while Speaker 2 could benefit from understanding that metaphors are often used in everyday conversation. Both could work towards clearer and more understanding communication."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "Speaker 1 used an idiomatic expression which may not be clear to everyone, including autistic individuals who might interpret language more literally. It's important to consider clarity and directness in communication. For instance, 'He has more important tasks to handle' might be clearer. Meanwhile, Speaker 2's response shows a literal interpretation of the idiom, demonstrating the need for explicit communication. Both communicative styles are valuable, and adjusting language use for clarity can enhance mutual understanding."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "Speaker 1: The phrase 'we're all in the same boat' is a metaphor that might be interpreted literally by someone who thinks more concretely, like an autistic individual. Consider explaining the metaphor or using more explicit language to ensure understanding. Speaker 2: Your question about the boat indicates a literal interpretation of the metaphor. It might be useful to follow up by asking for clarification if a non-literal phrase is used again."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "Speaker 2's response uses a metaphor that might not be easily understood by someone who interprets language more literally, which can be common for autistic individuals. To be more inclusive, it's helpful to use clear and direct language. Instead of 'Is there a storm over your head?', a more straightforward question could be 'Are you feeling ill or stressed?'"
