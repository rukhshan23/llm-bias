    "explanation": "Speaker 2 may be demonstrating a literal interpretation of Speaker 1's idiomatic expression 'playing with fire,' which is often used to indicate engaging in risky behavior.

    "autistic": "Speaker 2",
    "explanation": "Speaker 2's response suggests a literal interpretation of Speaker 1's metaphorical statement.

  {
    "autistic": "neither",
    "explanation": "Neither speaker's statement directly indicates they are autistic.

This interaction does not provide sufficient evidence to determine if either speaker is autistic, as both comments are within the realm of typical conversational behavior and metaphorical speech."

  {
    "autistic": "Speaker 2",
    "explanation": "Speaker 2 takes the metaphorical phrase 'up in the air' literally, which is often characteristic of autistic individuals who may have difficulty with figurative language.
