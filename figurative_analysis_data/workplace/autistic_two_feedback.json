    "feedback": "It seems like you took Speaker 1's words very literally. In conversations, people often use figurative expressions to convey their feelings or experiences. It might be helpful to focus on the emotions and meanings behind such phrases. You can ask for clarification or explore what they are truly expressing, rather than interpreting it in a literal way."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "It's important to recognize when someone is using figurative language, like metaphors, to express their thoughts or feelings. Instead of taking the phrase 'a ship lost at sea' literally, consider what it represents about the project, such as a lack of direction or clarity. You might ask clarifying questions to better understand the underlying meaning instead of interpreting it literally."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "It's great that you're engaging with Speaker 1! However, try to pay attention to the figurative language they use. When Speaker 1 mentioned 'juggling a million balls,' they were expressing that they are busy and have many tasks. Instead of responding literally about juggling, you could help by asking how you can support them with their presentations or if they need assistance with anything specific."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "It's great that you're engaging with Speaker 1, but remember that sometimes people use figurative language to express their feelings or concerns rather than to communicate literally. You might want to ask for clarification or share your understanding of their metaphorical point of view. For example, you could say, 'What do you mean by that? Is there something specific about the data that concerns you?' This way, you can get more insight into their thoughts and continue the conversation in a meaningful way."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "It's great that you're engaging with what Speaker 1 said! However, sometimes people use figurative language that isn't meant to be taken literally. In this case, 'dogfight' means a tough competition or struggle with the client requests, not an actual fight. It might be helpful to ask clarifying questions if you\u2019re unsure about the meaning behind someone's words."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "While it's great that you engaged with Speaker 1's ideas, it's important to recognize figurative language as a way to express creativity and emotions. In conversations, try to explore the metaphor rather than taking it literally. You could ask questions about what they mean by 'swimming in a vast ocean of possibilities' instead of suggesting a literal activity. This might help deepen the discussion and show interest in their thoughts."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "It's important to recognize figurative language in conversation. When someone uses a metaphor like 'hit by a freight train,' they are expressing strong feelings, not describing a real event. You might respond by acknowledging their feelings instead of interpreting it literally."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "It's great that you're engaging with Speaker 1's comment! However, when someone uses a figurative expression, they're often trying to express feelings or emotions in a colorful way rather than stating something literally. You might want to consider responding to the sentiment behind the figurative language instead. For instance, you could acknowledge that the meeting feels long or tedious, which would show understanding and connection with Speaker 1."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "It's okay to take things literally sometimes, but in conversations, people often use figurative language to express feelings or ideas. When someone uses a metaphor like 'deadlines are like shadows,' they might be feeling overwhelmed. Next time, you could ask them how they feel about the deadlines or share how you relate to the metaphor."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "It's great that you engaged with Speaker 1's comment! However, they were using a metaphor to express how exciting but fleeting their presentation was. In response, you might focus on expanding on their idea instead of taking it literally. For example, you could ask how to make the next presentation even more impactful, which aligns with their thinking. This can help improve your understanding of figurative language and enhance your communication."
