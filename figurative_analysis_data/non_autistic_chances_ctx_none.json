  {
    "chance": "low",
    "explanation": "The statement made by Speaker 2 demonstrates a literal interpretation of the idiom 'cutting corners,' which is more characteristic of autistic individuals. Non-autistic individuals are more likely to understand and respond to the idiom's figurative meaning, which refers to doing something poorly or not following all the necessary steps."
  },
  {
    "chance": "low",
    "explanation": "The metaphor 'in the driver\u2019s seat' is commonly understood to mean being in control or in a leading position on a project. A non-autistic person is more likely to understand this figurative language and respond appropriately within the context of project management, rather than interpreting it literally as involving an actual car."
  },
  {
    "chance": "low",
    "explanation": "The question from Speaker 2 misinterprets the idiomatic expression used by Speaker 1, suggesting a very literal understanding. This type of literal interpretation is more characteristic of autistic communication patterns, which often focus on concrete details and may miss figurative language. Non-autistic individuals are less likely to make this mistake, understanding the idiomatic expression 'lit a fire under the team' means to motivate or energize the team rather than involving an actual flame."
  },
  {
    "chance": "low",
    "explanation": "The statement by Speaker 2 shows a literal interpretation of the metaphor used by Speaker 1. Non-autistic individuals are generally more likely to recognize and understand figurative language and metaphors. Therefore, the chance that this statement was made by a non-autistic person is low."
  },
  {
    "chance": "high",
    "explanation": "The statement by Speaker 2 is a practical and literal response to Speaker 1's idiom 'connect the dots.' Non-autistic individuals are also capable of interpreting and replying to figurative language in a straightforward manner, especially when focused on solving a problem."
  },
  {
    "chance": "low",
    "explanation": "The statement by Speaker 1 is a metaphor, and a non-autistic person is more likely to recognize and understand that it is figurative. An autistic person might be more inclined to interpret the phrase literally, leading to the question posed by Speaker 2."
  },
  {
    "chance": "medium",
    "explanation": "The statement by Speaker 2 reflects a literal interpretation of a metaphorical phrase, which can be more common in autistic people. However, it is still possible for non-autistic people to playfully or humorously respond in this way, so the chance is medium."
  },
  {
    "chance": "medium",
    "explanation": "The statement made by Speaker 2 exhibits a literal interpretation of an idiomatic expression. While this can be common in individuals with autism, it is not exclusive to them and can also occur in non-autistic individuals, particularly if they are being playful or if they misunderstood the idiom. Therefore, the chance is medium."
  },
  {
    "chance": "high",
    "explanation": "The statement made by Speaker 2 seems unrelated and may indicate a misunderstanding or incorrect association with the term 'bandwagon.' This kind of literal interpretation or seemingly off-topic response can sometimes be indicative of an autistic person\u2019s communication style. However, such miscommunications can also occur with non-autistic people, especially in an informal or distracted context. Therefore, the likelihood of a non-autistic person making this statement is high."
  },
  {
    "chance": "low",
    "explanation": "Speaker 2's response is quite literal and seems to misinterpret the idiomatic expression used by Speaker 1. This type of literal interpretation is more commonly associated with autistic individuals, who may have difficulty understanding and using figurative language. Non-autistic individuals are typically more adept at recognizing and responding to idiomatic expressions."
  },
  {
    "chance": "low",
    "explanation": "The statement by Speaker 2 appears to interpret 'feeling blue' literally rather than understanding it as an idiomatic expression for feeling sad. This type of response is more characteristic of someone with autism, who may have difficulty with idiomatic language and take words at their face value."
  },
  {
    "chance": "low",
    "explanation": "The statement by Speaker 2 shows a literal interpretation of a common idiom. Non-autistic people are generally more familiar with idiomatic expressions and are less likely to interpret 'counting sheep' literally. This suggests a lower chance that a non-autistic person would make this statement."
  },
  {
    "chance": "low",
    "explanation": "The response from Speaker 2 takes the metaphorical statement from Speaker 1 literally, which is more characteristic of autistic communication patterns. Neurotypical individuals are generally more likely to recognize and understand the metaphor and not interpret it literally."
  },
  {
    "chance": "low",
    "explanation": "The statement by Speaker 2 likely reflects a literal interpretation of the metaphor used by Speaker 1. Non-autistic individuals are generally more adept at understanding and responding to figurative language in context. Hence, it's less likely that a non-autistic person would make such a literal comment."
