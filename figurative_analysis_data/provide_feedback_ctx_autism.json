    "feedback": "Speaker 2's response may be perceived as insensitive or dismissive, considering Speaker 1's expression of frustration. It would be more constructive for Speaker 2 to acknowledge Speaker 1's feelings and offer support or a solution. For example, Speaker 2 could say, 'I understand you're frustrated with the delays. Is there anything specific we can do to address this?' This kind of response would help improve communication by showing empathy and facilitating problem-solving."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "Speaker 2, it might be helpful to clarify if you are asking a genuine question or if you're being rhetorical. If it\u2019s a genuine question, you could ask, 'How is it possible for one person to handle all the responsibilities?' for clearer communication."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "Consider using more literal language to ensure clear understanding. For example, instead of 'I've got too many irons in the fire,' you could say, 'I have too many tasks to handle right now.' This reduces the risk of misinterpretation."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "It's important to recognize that 'heart of gold' is a metaphor meaning someone is very kind and caring. Speaker 2 might have taken it literally, possibly due to a more concrete way of thinking. To improve communication, Speaker 1 could clarify their use of the metaphor, or avoid figurative language if they know the listener prefers more direct communication."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "Speaker 2's response seems to take the metaphor 'taking off' literally, which can happen in conversations involving autistic individuals who may interpret language more concretely. To improve communication, Speaker 1 could use more explicit language to convey enthusiasm: 'This idea is progressing really well.' Additionally, Speaker 2 could ask for clarification if uncertain about the metaphor: 'What do you mean by that? Can you explain how the idea is progressing?'"
  },
  {
    "feedback": "For Speaker 2, it might be helpful to clarify if they are making a joke or if they genuinely misunderstood the idiom used by Speaker 1. This can help avoid confusion and ensure that the conversation stays on track. If Speaker 2 is autistic and may have difficulty with idiomatic expressions, it would be beneficial for Speaker 1 to recognize this and consider rephrasing their statement to make it more literal, such as saying, 'He really caused a lot of controversy during the meeting.'"
  },
  {
    "feedback": "In this exchange, Speaker 1 uses an idiom ('skating on thin ice') that might not be clear to everyone, especially someone who might take things literally. If the idiom is misunderstood, it could lead to confusion. To improve communication, Speaker 1 could use more direct language. For example, they could say 'They're taking a serious risk with this plan.' This direct approach avoids potential ambiguity. Speaker 2's response shows a literal interpretation of the idiom. Clarifying Speaker 1's point might help ensure both parties understand each other better."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "Speaker 2 appears to have taken the phrase 'walking encyclopedia' literally, which may indicate a misunderstanding. It could be helpful for Speaker 1 to clarify that this is a metaphor to improve mutual understanding."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "Speaker 2's response could be more empathetic and supportive. They could first acknowledge Speaker 1's frustration before offering a solution. For example, 'I\u2019m sorry to hear you're stuck. Have you considered trying a different approach?' This would help Speaker 1 feel heard and validated before moving into problem-solving."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "Speaker 2 interpreted Speaker 1's metaphor literally. For clearer communication, Speaker 1 could try to ensure their metaphors are understood by confirming with the listener. Speaker 2 could consider asking clarifying questions to better understand non-literal language."
