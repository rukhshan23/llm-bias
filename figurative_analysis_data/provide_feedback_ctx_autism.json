    "feedback": "Speaker 1 is using an idiom, 'hit the hay,' which means to go to sleep. Speaker 2 is interpreting this literally. To avoid confusion, Speaker 1 could use more direct language, such as 'I'm going to go to sleep early tonight.' Speaker 2 could ask for clarification in a way that acknowledges the idiom but seeks to understand, such as 'Do you mean you are going to sleep early?'"
  },
  {
    "feedback": "Speaker 1 is using an idiomatic expression to indicate they want to avoid a complex or difficult situation. Speaker 2 takes this expression literally, likely due to a more concrete thinking style. It may help Speaker 1 to clarify or provide more context for their statement to ensure mutual understanding, such as saying, 'I mean that discussing that topic might lead to complicated problems.'"
  },
  {
    "feedback": "Speaker 1 used an idiom, which can be confusing for some individuals, particularly if they are autistic and interpret language more literally. It might be helpful for Speaker 1 to explain the idiom or use more direct language."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "It looks like Speaker 2 may have misunderstood Speaker 1's idiomatic expression. Speaker 1 used 'hot water' metaphorically to mean 'trouble,' whereas Speaker 2 interpreted it literally. To avoid confusion, consider clarifying or avoiding idiomatic expressions when speaking with someone who might take language literally."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "Speaker 2's response introduces a literal interpretation of an idiomatic expression used by Speaker 1, which could cause confusion. To improve clarity, Speaker 2 could acknowledge the idiom before making a humorous comment. For example: 'I know you meant it figuratively, but can you imagine actually herding cats?'"
  },
  {
    "feedback": "Speaker 2, the phrase 'a tough nut to crack' is an idiom meaning something that is difficult to solve or deal with. It's important to understand or ask about idiomatic expressions if they are unclear."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "Speaker 1 used an idiom to express strong emotions, which can be confusing. Speaker 2 took the statement literally, which is common for some autistic people. To enhance understanding, it may help Speaker 1 to use more direct language or clarify their statement, and for Speaker 2 to consider context before responding literally."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "It seems there is a misunderstanding of an idiomatic expression. 'He's got bigger fish to fry' means he has more important things to do or focus on, not literally cooking fish. Clarifying idiomatic expressions and their meanings can help avoid such misunderstandings."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "Speaker 1 is using a metaphor to convey that everyone shares the same situation or challenge. Speaker 2's response indicates a potential misinterpretation of the metaphor as a literal statement. It might be helpful for Speaker 1 to clarify and restate the metaphor in a more direct manner to ensure understanding, such as 'We're all facing the same challenges with this project.'"
  },
  {
    "feedback": "Speaker 2's response could be confusing for someone who is autistic as it involves a metaphor. To improve clarity, Speaker 2 could respond with a more straightforward question like, 'Are you feeling sick?' or 'Are you okay?'"
