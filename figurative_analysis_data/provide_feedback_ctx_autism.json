    "feedback": "The exchange between speaker 1 and speaker 2 appears to lack coherence. Speaker 2's response does not logically follow or connect to what Speaker 1 said. To improve their communication, it could be helpful to ensure that both speakers stay on the same topic or clarify if a topic change is intended. This can help create a more meaningful and understandable dialogue."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "Speaker 1 used an idiom ('a tough nut to crack') that might be unclear for someone who tends to interpret language literally, such as an autistic individual. It's important to use clear, direct language to ensure mutual understanding. Speaker 2 interpreted the idiom literally, which suggests a possible misunderstanding. To improve communication, Speaker 1 could clarify what they mean by 'a tough nut to crack,' and Speaker 2 could also ask for clarification if they do not understand an expression."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "Speaker 2, it seems like there was a misunderstanding regarding the idiomatic expression 'feeling blue,' which means feeling sad or down. To improve communication, it would be beneficial to clarify such expressions to avoid confusion: 'I'm feeling sad today' would be more precise."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "Speaker 2 might benefit from understanding metaphors and expressions more deeply. Speaker 1 could provide clarification when using idiomatic language to ensure mutual understanding."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "Speaker 2 may benefit from understanding that Speaker 1 was using a metaphor. Clarifying this could help improve their understanding and communication. For example, Speaker 1 could follow up with an explanation, such as 'I mean that he keeps the team united and working well together.'"
  },
  {
    "feedback": "Speaker 2's response might be a literal interpretation of an idiom, which can lead to confusion. Speaker 2 could ask for clarification to better understand Speaker 1's point. Speaker 1 could ensure their point is clear and consider if using the idiom is the best choice for this conversation."
