    "feedback": "Speaker 1, it's helpful to be direct and explicit about your questions to avoid any misunderstandings. For example, you could ask, 'Can you tell me what the new deadline is?' Speaker 2, your response provides confirmation, which is good, but offering the specific information would be more helpful. For example, you could say, 'Yes, the new deadline is [date].'"
  },
  {
    "feedback": "For Speaker 1: You asked an indirect question, which might be confusing for someone interpreting language literally. Try to be more direct by asking 'Where are the files saved?' For Speaker 2: Your literal response indicates the potential for further clarification. You could add more information like 'Yes, I can tell you. The files are saved in [location].'"
  },
  {
    "feedback": "Speaker 1's question about the project is indirect and might require more specificity for clarity. Since Speaker 2 responded literally, it can be beneficial for Speaker 1 to follow up with more direct questions or statements to ensure mutual understanding. For example, Speaker 1 could ask, 'Have you made any progress on the project?' or 'Do you have any updates or concerns about the project?'"
  },
  {
    "feedback": "It's important to recognize and respect different communication styles. While Speaker 2's literal response is technically correct, it may be helpful for Speaker 1 to follow up with a direct request, such as 'Could you please send me the link to that report?'. This can help avoid any potential confusion."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "Speaker 1's question is implicitly asking for the time of the event. It would be helpful to clarify by directly asking for the specific information needed, for example, 'Can you tell me what time the event starts?'. Speaker 2 answered the question literally, which is common in autistic communication. To facilitate better understanding, Speaker 2 could follow up with the information or ask for clarification, for example, 'Yes, it starts at 3 PM.' or 'Do you need to know the time?'"
  },
  {
    "feedback": "Speaker 1 uses an indirect speech act by asking 'Can you explain the process to me?', which typically means they want the explanation provided. Speaker 2 interprets it literally and just confirms their ability to explain without actually doing so. If Speaker 2 is the autistic individual, it might be helpful for Speaker 1 to ask more directly, such as 'Please explain the process to me.' This can reduce misunderstandings and improve communication clarity."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "The dialogue appears clear and direct, which is often beneficial for effective communication, especially for individuals who are autistic and may prefer straightforward language. It is valuable to ensure that instructions or questions are direct to facilitate accurate understanding and response."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "The dialogue demonstrates a mix-up due to indirect and literal language use. Speaker 1's request, 'Do you mind checking the document for errors?' is a polite indirect way of asking for help, whereas Speaker 2's literal response, 'No, I don't mind,' technically means they agree to help. However, it may sound ambiguous without explicitly agreeing to the action. For clearer communication, Speaker 1 could ask directly, 'Can you check the document for errors?' and Speaker 2 could respond more clearly, 'Sure, I'll check it now,' to confirm their willingness to help."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "To enhance communication, consider giving a direct response that addresses the underlying question. For example, Speaker 2 could say, 'Yes, John is in charge of the meeting.' This helps ensure clarity and meets the conversational needs of all parties."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "Speaker 1's question is a common indirect speech act intended to prompt detailed information about the task's status. Speaker 2's literal response could be improved by offering more specifics to facilitate clearer communication. For example, Speaker 2 could elaborate on the updates to ensure mutual understanding."
