    "feedback": "Speaker 1 used an indirect way of asking for specific information about the deadline, which might not be clear for some individuals, particularly those with different communication processing styles. It could be helpful to ask more directly, such as 'Can you tell me what the new deadline is?' Speaker 2 responded correctly but could provide more detail to enhance clarity."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "Speaker 1, consider being more direct by asking 'Where are the files saved?' to ensure clarity. Speaker 2, your literal response is accurate, but expanding on it with the specific information would be helpful."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "Speaker 1's indirect question implies a request for specifics about the project. Considering neurodiversity, it may be helpful for Speaker 1 to be more explicit in their communication. For example, they could ask, 'Can you share your thoughts on the project's progress or any ideas you have?' This clarifies expectations and aids those who might process indirect speech differently. Speaker 2 responded appropriately to the literal question asked. Both speakers should continue to be mindful of clarity and directness in their communication, fostering better understanding."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "Speaker 1 used an indirect request which could be misinterpreted, though Speaker 2 responded positively. For clearer communication, especially considering neurodiversity, Speaker 1 could be more direct, e.g., 'Please send me the link to that report.' This reduces ambiguity. Speaker 2, while correctly understanding the request, may benefit from confirming their willingness to help, e.g., 'Sure, I will send it right away.'"
  },
  {
    "feedback": "Speaker 1 may want to ask more directly, like 'What time does the event start?' to avoid potential confusion. Speaker 2's literal response is valid and shows understanding, but providing the requested information might be more helpful in this context. Recognize that different communication styles include varied responses and the importance of clear, direct questions for clarity."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "Speaker 1, your question may be interpreted as a request for information or an offer by Speaker 2 to explain. It might be clearer to directly state what you need, such as 'Can you please explain the process to me now?' or similar. Speaker 2, confirming that you understand the request and are willing to comply can be helpful, such as replying with 'I can explain it to you now. Here is the process...'. This ensures both parties are on the same page and accommodates various communication preferences."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "Both speakers communicated effectively, but for enhanced clarity and to accommodate diverse communication styles, Speaker 1 could consider rephrasing their question to be more direct, such as 'Can you tell me what the client feedback says?' This helps ensure the intent is clear for all neurodiverse individuals. Speaker 2 responded appropriately by confirming their action, though providing more detail could be beneficial. For instance, they might add, 'Yes, I have looked into it. Here are the main points of their feedback.' This provides additional information that could aid in mutual understanding."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "Speaker 1: You used an indirect speech act by asking 'Do you mind checking the document for errors?' which could be misinterpreted by those who interpret communication more literally, such as some neurodivergent individuals. Consider being more direct, e.g., 'Please check the document for errors.' Speaker 2: You responded literally, which shows clear communication. If you meant that you would check the document and didn't mind doing so, you might add that confirmation to make your intention clearer, e.g., 'No, I don't mind. I'll check it now.'"
  },
  {
    "feedback": "Speaker 1 used an indirect speech act, which could be interpreted differently depending on the individual's communication style. It's valuable to remember that some people, especially those who are neurodivergent, might interpret and respond to language more literally. To improve clarity, Speaker 1 could ask their question more directly next time, such as 'Who is in charge of the meeting?' Speaker 2 responded accurately to the question asked and should continue to feel confident in their literal interpretation and response."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "It's important to recognize that different people have different communication styles. Speaker 1 used an indirect approach which might not always be clear to everyone. Speaker 2's direct and literal response shows an understanding of the question but might benefit from providing more detailed information. Both speakers could benefit from mutual understanding and appreciation of their unique communication preferences. Encouraging open dialogue about preferred communication styles can enhance clarity and mutual respect in their interactions."
