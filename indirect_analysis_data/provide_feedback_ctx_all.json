    "feedback": "It's important to recognize that different individuals may have varying communication styles, especially in neurodiverse interactions. Speaker 1's indirect way of asking for the specific deadline might be unclear to someone who prefers direct communication, such as an autistic person. To improve clarity, Speaker 1 could directly ask, 'What is the new deadline?' This direct approach can help avoid any potential misunderstanding and ensure effective communication."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "Speaker 1, your indirect request may not be clear to everyone, especially to someone who might interpret language more literally. Try to be more specific by directly asking, 'Where are the files saved?' Speaker 2, your literal response is valid, but it might be helpful to provide the requested information directly if you know it."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "In this dialogue, Speaker 1 uses an indirect speech act by asking a question that might imply a request for a more detailed status update on the project. Speaker 2 responds literally to the question asked. It's important to recognize and respect the different communication styles, especially in a neurodiverse context. Speaker 1 could benefit from being more direct and explicit in their request, for example by asking 'Can you give me an update on the project's progress?' This can help avoid potential miscommunication. Speaker 2's literal response is also valid and clear within their communication style. Both speakers might improve their interaction by acknowledging and adapting to each other's communication preferences."

  {
    "feedback": "It's important to recognize that communication styles can vary significantly, especially in a neurodiverse context. Speaker 1's indirect request may come across as unclear or ambiguous to someone who prefers more direct communication. To improve clarity and ensure both parties understand each other, Speaker 1 could make a more explicit request like, 'Could you please send me the link to that report?' Speaker 2, there's nothing wrong with your literal response, but you could also try providing the requested information directly to enhance communication. This consideration can help bridge any differences in communication preferences and ensure smoother interactions."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "Speaker 1, consider explicitly asking for the information you need to accommodate different communication styles (e.g., 'Can you tell me when the event starts?'). Speaker 2, it may be helpful to provide the information being sought (e.g., 'Yes, it starts at 3 PM'). This can ensure clear and effective communication for everyone involved."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "Speaker 1, your question could be more direct to aid clarity, for example, 'Can you explain the process to me now?' Speaker 2, your response was clear but could be expanded with additional information, such as 'Yes, I can explain it. The process involves the following steps...' This approach accommodates diverse communication preferences and ensures mutual understanding."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "Speaker 1, consider clearly stating your specific request, such as 'Could you share your thoughts on the client feedback?' to reduce ambiguity. Speaker 2, your response is clear and informative."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "Speaker 1, when communicating with someone who might interpret language literally, it can be helpful to use more direct language. For example, 'Please check the document for errors.' This clarity can support effective communication. Speaker 2, your response is clear and direct. If you want to add more context, you could say, 'No, I don't mind. I'll check the document now.'"
  },
  {
    "feedback": "Speaker 1, your question about who is in charge of the meeting is indirect, which could be confusing for someone who prefers direct communication, such as many autistic individuals. You might rephrase it more explicitly, for example, 'Who is in charge of the meeting?' Speaker 2, your literal response to the question is valid and correct. If you are comfortable, you could follow up with the specific information being requested to ensure clarity."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "Speaker 1, your indirect approach to asking about the status of the task might be confusing for some who prefer direct communication. A more straightforward question, like 'What are the updates on the task?' could be clearer. Speaker 2, your literal response was appropriate, but adding more detail about the updates might enhance communication. Valuing both communication styles is important, and finding a balance between directness and context can help improve understanding for everyone."
