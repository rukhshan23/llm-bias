    "explanation": "Speaker 2 is at fault for the communication breakdown because they did not directly answer Speaker 1's question. Speaker 1 is asking for the status of the budget approval, but Speaker 2's response merely confirms their own awareness of the status without providing the actual information. This lack of a direct answer prevents the communication from being effective."
