    "explanation": "Speaker 2's response is direct and to the point, which can be a communication style associated with autistic individuals. They offer a clear and concise answer without additional context or elaboration, reflecting a tendency for straightforward communication.

This kind of communication style can be associated with autistic individuals, who may prefer to respond in clear, direct ways and might not infer the need for additional information unless explicitly asked. Speaker 1 asked a straightforward question expecting specific information (i.e., the time when the sessions start), but Speaker 2's response only confirms their ability to provide such information without actually providing it."
