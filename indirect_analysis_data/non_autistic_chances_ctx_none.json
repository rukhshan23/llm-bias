    "chance": "low",
    "explanation": "The response from Speaker 2 directly repeats the question structure rather than providing a straightforward answer or additional information. This type of literal repetition is more commonly associated with autistic language patterns, which can include echolalia or a more literal use of language."
  },
  {
    "chance": "medium",
    "explanation": "While Speaker 2's response is quite literal and somewhat redundant, it does not definitively indicate whether the speaker is autistic or non-autistic. Non-autistic people can also give literal responses, though they might more commonly provide a direct answer to the question. Therefore, the chances are medium."
  },
  {
    "chance": "high",
    "explanation": "The statement made by Speaker 2 is direct and to the point, which is a communication style that is common among both non-autistic and autistic individuals. There is nothing in the statement that specifically suggests it is more likely to have been made by an autistic person rather than a non-autistic person. Therefore, the chance is high that a non-autistic person could have made the statement."
  },
  {
    "chance": "low",
    "explanation": "A non-autistic person would likely provide more specific information in response to the question rather than just confirming they know. They might name the person who approved the budget changes or indicate how they know. The given response is more typical of an autistic communication style, which can be more literal and concise."
  },
  {
    "chance": "high",
    "explanation": "The response by Speaker 2 is direct and straightforward, which is common in both non-autistic and autistic communication. Since the statement does not exhibit characteristics that are uniquely indicative of autistic communication, the chances are high that it could be made by a non-autistic person."
  },
  {
    "chance": "low",
    "explanation": "The response from Speaker 2 is somewhat literal and lacks additional context or elaboration. Non-autistic individuals might typically provide more context or ask for clarification. This direct and literal response is more commonly associated with autistic communication styles."
  },
  {
    "chance": "high",
    "explanation": "The response provided by Speaker 2 is direct and fact-based, which is typical of how many people, regardless of whether they are autistic or not, might communicate in a professional setting. The brevity and clarity of the response do not indicate a particular likelihood of being from either an autistic or a non-autistic person."
  },
  {
    "chance": "medium",
    "explanation": "The response given by Speaker 2 is quite direct and lacks elaboration, which can sometimes be more characteristic of autistic communication styles. However, non-autistic people can also provide direct answers based on context and individual communication preferences. Therefore, while this type of response might be slightly more associated with autistic individuals, it is not definitive, making the chance 'medium'."
