Speaker 2 responds with a vague and somewhat formal reply, stating that it starts at the 'designated hour we agreed upon,' which may suggest difficulties with social communication and inferencing that can be associated with autism. The response lacks the specificity expected in a typical conversation where someone would simply state the actual time.
