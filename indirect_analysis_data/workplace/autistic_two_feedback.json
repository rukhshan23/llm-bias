    "feedback": "It's great that you responded literally, but you might want to consider the context of conversations and how people may not always mean what they say directly. In this case, Speaker 1 might be expressing concern about busyness rather than just stating an observation. You could try to engage more by acknowledging their concern or sharing your own feelings about productivity."

    "feedback": "It's great that you responded literally, which is a clear and straightforward way to communicate. However, in this situation, Speaker 1 was expressing a feeling rather than asking for information. Sometimes, indirect speech acts can convey emotions or thoughts that aren't stated directly. You might try to engage with their feelings by acknowledging their comment or sharing your own feelings about the quietness. For example, you could say, 'I agree! It's peaceful, isn't it?' This can help create a more connected conversation."

    "feedback": "It's great that you acknowledged the importance of good help! However, when someone makes an indirect statement, like Speaker 1's comment about finding good help, they might be expressing frustration or seeking validation. You could try responding in a way that shows you understand their feelings. For example, you might say, 'I can understand that; it can be really tough to find the right people to work with.' This way, your response addresses the emotion behind the statement."
  },
  {
    "feedback": "It's great that you responded directly to Speaker 1's suggestion! However, you might improve understanding by acknowledging their point before reinforcing the importance of priorities. For example, you could say, 'I agree, reevaluating our priorities sounds important, and they really help us focus our efforts better.' This way, you show that you heard their concern and then build on it."
